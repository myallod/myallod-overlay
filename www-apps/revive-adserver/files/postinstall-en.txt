To complete the install:

1) Use a web browser to visit http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}${VHOST_APPDIR}
   and follow the instructions in the installation wizard to complete the installation.
   
   Recommended PHP settings to check before configuring:
   
   magic_quotes_runtime Off
   safe_mode Off
   file_uploads On

2) After the configuration is finished, do not forget to change the permissions
   on ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/config.inc.php to safer ones so that the file is not writeable
   by your webserver!

3) Use cron to run the scripts/maintenance/maintenance.php
   script, with the domain of your site as a parameter, every hour, eg:

   0 * * * * /usr/bin/php -q ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/scripts/maintenance/maintenance.php ${VHOST_HOSTNAME}
